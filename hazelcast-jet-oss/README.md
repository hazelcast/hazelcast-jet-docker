# Hazelcast Jet Docker Images

[Hazelcast Jet](https://jet-start.sh) is a distributed computing
platform built for high-performance stream processing and fast batch
processing. It embeds Hazelcast In-Memory Data Grid (IMDG) to provide a
lightweight package of a processor and a scalable in-memory storage.

Visit [Hazelcast Jet Website](https://jet-start.sh) to learn more about
the architecture and use-cases.

## Hazelcast Jet Quick Start

For the simplest end-to-end scenario, you can create a Hazelcast Jet
cluster with two Docker containers and access it from the client
application.

```bash
docker run -p 5701:5701 hazelcast/hazelcast-jet
docker run -p 5702:5701 hazelcast/hazelcast-jet
```

For Hazelcast Jet Management Center
```bash
docker run -p 8081:8081 hazelcast/hazelcast-jet-management-center
```

> Hazelcast Jet Management Center is free for single node cluster. If
> you have a license key you can provide it via `-e MC_LICENSE_KEY=...`
> and connect to larger cluster.  

Note that:

* each container must publish the `5701` port under a different host
  machine port (`5701` and `5702` in the example)
* `<host_ip>` needs to be the host machine address that will be used for
  the Hazelcast communication

After setting up the cluster, you can start the client application to
check it works correctly.

Please go to the [Hazelcast Jet website](https://jet-start.sh/docs/next/operations/docker)
for more thorough documentation regarding the configuration, job
submission, docker-compose and packaging.
